## Redux Middleware Demo

Experimenting with custom middleware that allows me to manually handle promise resolution (instead of passing control to something like Redux Thunk/Promise). 

Gets data from JSONPlaceholder API. Two actions: one for fetching using and another for deleting them. You can delete users by clicking on them.

This application was adapted from my [React Redux Base App](https://github.com/conradknapp/react-redux-base-app) Repo
